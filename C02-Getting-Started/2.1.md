### Exercises 2.1-3
***
Consider the searching problem:

* **Input**: A sequence of n numbers A = [a1, a2, . . . , an] and a value v.
* **Output**: An index i such that v = A[i] or the special value NIL if v does not appear in A.


Write pseudocode for **linear search**, which scans through the sequence, looking for v. Using a loop invariant, prove that your algorithm is correct. Make sure that your loop invariant fulfills the three necessary properties.

### `Answer`
The loop invariant is that all indices <i,  {1, …, i-1} have values in A s.t. the point in A at which they index does not equal v.

Initialization:
The empty set trivially does not contain any indices that index to value in A that equals v

Maintenance:
From step i-1 to i, if A[i] is not vadd I to the loop invariant set. Otherwise, return i. This holds the loop that none of the indices less thani are equal to v.

Termination:
Either the algorithm has terminated already once i=A.length+1 or the v is not in the loop. In either case the loop invariant still holds. In the first case, we have found v in A. In the latter case, we choose to return NIL.

### Exercises 2.1-4
***
Consider the problem of adding two n-bit binary integers, stored in two n-element arrays A and B. The sum of the two integers should be stored in binary form in an (n + 1)-element array C. State the problem formally and write pseudocode for adding the two integers.

### `Answer`
![pic](./repo/s1/algorithm.png)

Loop invariant: The subarray C[i+2, …, C.length] where s.t. i+2 < C.length has the correct binary digits for the computational problem of binary addition.

Initialization: empty subarray trivially has the correct binary digit addition

Maintenance:
	From i+1 to I, we know everything from i+2 to C.length is correctly added.
	
	In this step, we add the i+1 digit of C correctly, then, when we get to i-1, the ith digit is aded properly.
	
Termination:
	At the termination of the loop i=0, and we know that C[i+2,…C.length] isas the correct binary addition. Which is to say we've added C[2,…,c.length] correctly.
	
	
Now to make sure the algorithm is correct, outside of using the loop invariant, we need to set C[1] to have the correct binary digit, which is done outside of the loop.
```
C = Array[A.length+1]
carry <- 0,
for i <- A.length to 1
    C[i+1] <- (A[i] + B[i] + carry) % 2;
    carry = (A[i] + B[i] + carry)/2;
C[1] <- carry;
return C
```
